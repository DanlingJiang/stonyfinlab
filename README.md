Q: How to use Simply Static to export Wordpress webpage as HTML?

To export a WordPress webpage as HTML using the Simply Static plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Install Simply Static**
   - In your WordPress dashboard, go to *Plugins* > *Add New*.
   - Search for "Simply Static," install, and activate the plugin[1][3][5].

2. **Configure Settings**
   - Go to *Simply Static* > *Settings*.
   - In the *General* tab, set your preferred URL and delivery method (e.g., ZIP archive, local directory, or other options).
   - Use the *Include/Exclude* section if you want to specify which pages or files to export[1][3][5].

3. **Generate Static HTML Files**
   - Go to *Simply Static* > *Generate*.
   - Click the **Generate Static Files** button. The plugin will convert your WordPress site (or selected pages) into static HTML, CSS, and JS files[1][3][4][5].
   - Monitor progress in the Activity Log.

4. **Download the Export**
   - Once complete, download the ZIP archive or access the exported files in your chosen directory.
   - Youâ€™ll find your site as static HTML, ready for deployment anywhere[1][4][5].

This process quickly turns your dynamic WordPress content into static HTML files for fast, secure hosting or further use[1][3][4][6].

Q: How to upload the ZIP files from Simply Static to Github depository?


To upload the ZIP files exported from Simply Static to a GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to GitHub**
   - Go to github.com and log in to your account[2].

2. **Create a New Repository (if needed)**
   - On your GitHub dashboard, click "New" to create a repository.
   - Fill in the repository name and details, then click "Create repository"[2][5].

3. **Upload the ZIP File**
   - In your repository, click the **Add file** button, then select **Upload files**.
   - Drag and drop your Simply Static ZIP file onto the page or use the file picker to select it[2].
   - After the upload, scroll down and click **Commit changes** to finish adding the ZIP file to your repository[2].

**Note:**  
- If you want the static site contents (not just the ZIP archive) to be available for deployment (e.g., with Vercel or GitHub Pages), extract the ZIP on your computer first, then upload the extracted files and folders instead of the ZIP file itself[2][5].

This will make your static HTML files accessible in the repository for further deployment or hosting.
