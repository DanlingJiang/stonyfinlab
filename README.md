Simply Static exported HTML file from stonyfinlab.org, for importing to Vercel

Q: How to convert a Wordpress made webpage into Github HTML to import it to Vercel using Next.js

To convert a WordPress-made webpage into HTML and deploy it to Vercel using Next.js, follow these concise steps:

**1. Convert WordPress to Static HTML**
- Use a plugin like *Simply Static* or *Export WP Page to Static HTML & PDF* to export your WordPress site or specific pages as static HTML, CSS, and JS files[4][10][8][14].
- Download the generated HTML files and assets to your computer.

**2. Prepare a Next.js Project**
- Create a new Next.js project if you don’t have one:
  ```bash
  npx create-next-app my-site
  cd my-site
  ```
- Place your exported HTML, CSS, and JS files in the `public` directory of your Next.js project. This allows you to serve them as static assets[5].

**3. Import or Link HTML in Next.js**
- For simple static pages, you can create new pages in the `pages` directory and use ``, or copy the HTML content into React components.
- Alternatively, link directly to the static HTML files in the `public` folder (e.g., `yourdomain.com/my-exported-page.html`).

**4. Push to GitHub**
- Initialize a git repo, commit your code, and push it to GitHub.

**5. Deploy to Vercel**
- Go to Vercel, import your GitHub repository, and follow the prompts. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and handle the build and deployment for you[7][9][15].
- No extra configuration is needed for static files-Vercel will serve everything in the `public` directory as static assets.

**Summary Table**

| Step                | Tool/Action                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Export HTML         | Simply Static / Export WP Page to HTML plugin  |
| Next.js Setup       | Place files in `/public` or convert to pages   |
| Push to GitHub      | Standard git workflow                          |
| Deploy to Vercel    | Import repo, Vercel auto-detects Next.js       |

This approach lets you migrate static WordPress content into a modern Next.js/Vercel workflow with minimal hassle[4][8][7].

3. **Generate Static HTML Files**

Q: How to upload the ZIP files from Simply Static to Github depository?


To upload the ZIP files exported from Simply Static to a GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to GitHub**
   - Go to github.com and log in to your account[2].

2. **Create a New Repository (if needed)**
   - On your GitHub dashboard, click "New" to create a repository.
   - Fill in the repository name and details, then click "Create repository"[2][5].

3. **Upload the ZIP File**
   - In your repository, click the **Add file** button, then select **Upload files**.
   - Drag and drop your Simply Static ZIP file onto the page or use the file picker to select it[2].
   - After the upload, scroll down and click **Commit changes** to finish adding the ZIP file to your repository[2].

**Note:**  
- If you want the static site contents (not just the ZIP archive) to be available for deployment (e.g., with Vercel or GitHub Pages), extract the ZIP on your computer first, then upload the extracted files and folders instead of the ZIP file itself[2][5].

This will make your static HTML files accessible in the repository for further deployment or hosting.
